Memer is a decentralized social media DApp built on the Lens Protocol and powered by [Streamr](https://www.streamr.network/). It allows you to sign in with your Lens profile and see a feed of memes that you and everyone you follow have posted. Memer enables you to create, share, and discover memes in a decentralized way, providing a new level of interaction and freedom in the social media landscape. With Streamr's real-time data infrastructure, Memer offers a powerful and innovative chatting experience alongside meme sharing.

## Features

- Sign in with your Lens profile
- View a feed of memes posted by you and those you follow
- Choose from 12 default meme templates or upload your own image to create a meme
- Submit memes as a post to the Lens Protocol, making them visible across all Lens DApps, like Lenster
- Access meme-specific chatrooms powered by Streamr Chat

## Streamr Chat Integration

Memer integrates [Streamr Chat](https://www.streamr.network/thechat), a decentralized instant messenger built on the Streamr Network, to provide a seamless and decentralized chatting experience alongside the shared memes. Streamr Chat brings a game-changing feature set to Memer, enabling users to:

- Chat with the world in public chatrooms
- Create private chatrooms for more intimate conversations
- Set up token-gated chatrooms, where access is granted only to users holding a certain amount of a specified token

### Setting up Streamr Chat in Memer

How I integrated Streanr Chat in Memer:

1. Download the Streamr Chat source code from Github:
git clone https://github.com/streamr-dev/chat

2. Install the dependencies:
npm install

3. Start the app for development and usage on your own machine:
npm start

By following these steps, you'll have Streamr Chat integrated into your DApp, providing a truly decentralized and interactive social media experience.

## Conclusion

Memer, built on the Lens Protocol and powered by [Streamr](https://www.streamr.network/), offers a unique decentralized social media experience, enabling users to share memes and engage in conversations without restrictions. The integration of Streamr Chat pushes the boundaries of traditional social media, paving the way for a new era of decentralized communication and content sharing.
